  "raw_description": "Crafted by the wise and powerful mages, the spell of the Veil takes many forms and applications. But its purpose remains unchanged - it hides the Champion from the eyes of his or her foes, allowing for a perfect strike to be delivered when the time is right.<br>This buff has two tiers: Veil and Perfect Veil. The Champion under either of these buffs cannot be chosen as a target of an enemy Championâ€™s Skill. Note: if all remaining Champions on your team have an active Veil or Perfect Veil effect, the enemy will no longer be restricted in choosing a target. In the case of basic Veil, the effect will be immediately lifted if the Champion uses a Skill that deals damage. With the exception of:<br>Damage inflicted by the Skill that applies [Veil] (if applicable)<br>Passive damage<br>Damage that \"Does not count as a hit\"<br>At the same time, [Perfect Veil] is not affected, no matter what Skills the Champion uses. Thus it allows them to strike with impunity for as long as the buff remains active - or they have a wall of allies to hide behind.",
