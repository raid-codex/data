  "lore": "<p>The Lizardmen society is hardly homogenous. While some tribes live nearly as humans and elves of old did, building settlements and crafting tools, others are little more than intelligence predators that live and hunt in packs. Jareg is the leader of one such “family”, having guided it for many decades. He may not be a peerless strategist or a weaponmaster, but there are two qualities forged by the hardships he had to endure that are invaluable – tenacity and instinct. As pack leader, it is Jareg’s duty to defend his kin from whatever danger they might face as well as lead them in hunts and battle for more territory. Over decades of constant strife, he learned to protect those who depend on him, even if it means placing himself in harm’s way. And, surprisingly, his knowledge of herms and their properties allows Jareg to provide basic but efficient relief to wounds and injuries that his allies might suffer.</p>",
