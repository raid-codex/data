Were if not for the occasional mercenary or merchant, their very existence might have been forgotten.<br>It was only the recent invasion by the demonic legions of Siroth and their undead minions that has opened the eyes of the Dwarven King to grim reality. Through courage, determination, and sacrifice, the unholy horde has eventually been repelled. But the devastation that it wrought was too great to ignore. Now, driven forth by the calls for justice, Dwarves send their greatest heroes to the surface to bring the battle to their hated foe.",

Indeed, many of the arms and amour that come out of their blazing forges are enchanted with a variety of spells. But some go further than that still. It is not uncommon for wealthy Jarls to arm their best warriors with equipment that has been steeped in magic or hexed in a very specific way. Weapons that dissipate and block the foe’s own magical enhancements are a particularly popular choice. Sometimes, the warriors themselves are subjected to a variety of spells to strengthen them or even just change their appearance to a more intimidating one. ",
