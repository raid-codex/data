Were if not for the occasional mercenary or merchant, their very existence might have been forgotten.<br>It was only the recent invasion by the demonic legions of Siroth and their undead minions that has opened the eyes of the Dwarven King to grim reality. Through courage, determination, and sacrifice, the unholy horde has eventually been repelled. But the devastation that it wrought was too great to ignore. Now, driven forth by the calls for justice, Dwarves send their greatest heroes to the surface to bring the battle to their hated foe.",

Beasts, brigands, even an occasional Ogryn or Ork incursion were commonplace. As such, the need for dedicated wardens and scouts had arisen, and many brave Dwarves heeded the call. The Tunnel Stewards, as they are called, are a volunteer militia. They eschew heavy armour in favour of greater mobility and often prefer ranged weapons that allow them to engage the enemy and withdraw whenever they choose. Given the tough nature of the underground beasts they face, Tunnel Stewards are not above coating their arrows and quivers in poison, or using other less direct means of gaining the upper hand. </p>",
