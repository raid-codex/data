But he was still given an opportunity to serve in the vanguard of many raids - an honour given in the hopes that he would one day get himself killed. That, however, never happened, and Skink now commands the loyalty and respect of an ever-growing group of young warriors, much to the displeasure of his rivals. Skink believes that one day he shall overtake his detractors to become the greatest leader the Lizardmen tribes have ever known.</p>"
