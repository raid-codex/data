Charged with the Queen’s safekeeping during the height of the wars with Kaerok, he abandoned his place at her side to seek out a legendary blade in the lands beyond the Dark Ravine. Said to cut even the strongest of tempered steel, it rests now at his side – but the price was dear.</p><p>The lands of Aravia and the road back to Darkwoord Forest are closed to him for his betrayal. With a price upon his head, his kin will not risk the Queen’s wrath to give him welcome. And so, he wanders Teleria endlessly, friend to none, a dark servant without a master...</p>",
