Shambling skeletons and risen corpses may not be bright, but what they lack in intelligence they make up for in sheer number. Yet, not all Undead are witless marionettes.</p><p>Some servants of Shadow consign their souls and Shards to their dark masters, and after death retain a spark of their former self. And with it, their skills and talents. Once a master hunter, the Hollow remains dangerous with his bow even as a rotting corpse, capable of finding chinks in even the toughest armour.</p>"
