And in the end, life as a cripple toughened the lizardman and forged him into a relentless bute. Now grown and with his arm replaced by a crude and vicious blade, he is still said to terrorize the streets of Irith at times in search of the butcher who took his arm - but perhaps that is merely an urban legend born of the Slitherbrute’s terrifying appearance.</p>",
