Stealing meat and fish from the stands on the market, his luck soon ran out and his arm lost to an angered butcher’s hatchet.</p><p>Doomed to die in the gutter, he has only survived due to luck and the kindness of his fellow destitutes. And in the end, life as a cripple toughened the lizardman and forged him into a relentless bute. Now grown and with his arm replaced by a crude and vicious blade, he is still said to terrorize the streets of Irith at times in search of the butcher who took his arm - but perhaps that is merely an urban legend born of the Slitherbrute’s terrifying appearance.</p>"
