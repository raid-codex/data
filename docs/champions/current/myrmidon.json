Theirs is an ancient and proud name, one that can be traced back to the fearsome warriors who served the City-States before Kaerok came to be. Those were the dreaded heavy infantry, the mailed fist of any army the tyrants of old commanded. Their skill with the spears was legendary, and so was their resilience. Modern Myrmidons strive to be worthy of that legend, and only veteran soldiers who have survived countless battles against overwhelming odds may be honoured with the title. Their spears have been replaced with axes and maces and strong oaken shields, their armour adorned with the heraldry of their suzerains and badges of honour. Seeing these fearless heroes charge into the midst of enemy formations is an inspiring sight – unless you find yourself on the wrong side of a Myrmidon’s axe, of course.</p>",
