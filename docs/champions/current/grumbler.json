Were if not for the occasional mercenary or merchant, their very existence might have been forgotten.<br>It was only the recent invasion by the demonic legions of Siroth and their undead minions that has opened the eyes of the Dwarven King to grim reality. Through courage, determination, and sacrifice, the unholy horde has eventually been repelled. But the devastation that it wrought was too great to ignore. Now, driven forth by the calls for justice, Dwarves send their greatest heroes to the surface to bring the battle to their hated foe.",

  "lore": "<p>It is a well-known fact that a proper Dwarf is made up of these three essential elements: a beard, a heavy armour along with an axe or shield, and a foul temper. Indeed, Dwarves absolutely need to complain about something constantly, lest they wither away – so the wisdom of High Elves says anyway. The Grumblers personify that, albeit few call them that to their faces. These veteran warriors make up the backbone of many Dwarven armies, and their skill is only matched by their constant displeasure with this or that. But one should not be fooled by this dour attitude. Like many of their kind, Grumblers will gladly put themselves in harm’s way for their allies and fight to their last breath if they have to. It would be difficult to find a more dedicated friend, even if securing the respect of grizzled Dwarven soldiers is no easy task.</p>",
