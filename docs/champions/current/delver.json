With her mind as sharp as the quarrels of her crossbow, she excels at taking advantage of and multiplying her victims’ weaknesses. And though her origins are not known, some speculate that the moniker was earned by her ceaseless interest to old Elven ruins scattered across the continent. No one knows what she seeks there, but those unfortunate souls brave or foolish enough to assist her expedition for coin are rarely heard from again.</p>"
