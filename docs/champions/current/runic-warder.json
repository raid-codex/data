Were if not for the occasional mercenary or merchant, their very existence might have been forgotten.<br>It was only the recent invasion by the demonic legions of Siroth and their undead minions that has opened the eyes of the Dwarven King to grim reality. Through courage, determination, and sacrifice, the unholy horde has eventually been repelled. But the devastation that it wrought was too great to ignore. Now, driven forth by the calls for justice, Dwarves send their greatest heroes to the surface to bring the battle to their hated foe.",

Through it, he imbued them with a sliver of his divine genius and ensured the Dwarves would remain the best blacksmiths Teleria has ever seen. It is no surprise then that the Children of Stone revere these ancient Runes and use them extensively in both their craft and their religious ceremonies. Runic Wardens, in particular, are honoured warriors and priests both, whose example guides their kin in the times of peace and in the times of war alike. Clad in the finest gilded armour, the Wardens lead the charge, bolstering their allies and baffling the enemy. Their knowledge of runecraft allows these Champions to enhance those who fight at their side with arcane protection and even heal injuries, sustained in righteous battle.</p>",
