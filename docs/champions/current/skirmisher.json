Sometimes, the sheer rage and fury that they are associated with are not enough, and cunning tactics must be applied. Thus the use of skirmishers, armed with bows or javelins, is not uncommon. These warriors appear out of nowhere, strike at any vulnerability they can find, and disappear like ghosts.</p><p>This Champion in particular has honed her talent to take advantage of an opportunity. She knows that denying an enemyâ€™s advantage is crucial to ensuring victory. And so she will employ any means necessary to bereave the foe of enchantments and slow them down to let her allies seize the initiative.</p>",
