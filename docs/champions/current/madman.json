Were if not for the occasional mercenary or merchant, their very existence might have been forgotten.<br>It was only the recent invasion by the demonic legions of Siroth and their undead minions that has opened the eyes of the Dwarven King to grim reality. Through courage, determination, and sacrifice, the unholy horde has eventually been repelled. But the devastation that it wrought was too great to ignore. Now, driven forth by the calls for justice, Dwarves send their greatest heroes to the surface to bring the battle to their hated foe.",

  "lore": "<p>Even among the criminals and outcasts of society, there are those who may yet rise to greatness and, perhaps, even find redemption. Though few know the Madman’s name – and fewer still care – he has already managed to make a mark on the surface. Indeed, when a screeching and heavily tattooed Dwarf charges at a horde of undead before your very eyes, forgetting it will prove difficult. Once, he was a gang leader, a merciless and unprincipled scoundrel who would rob and intimidate the honest folk to get what he wants. His exile must have set a few things right – or unhinged him even further. So when an opportunity for pardon had presented itself, this Madman took it gladly. Though hardly a sophisticated fighter, he can still offer his blade and fights with crazed determination, slashing and stabbing at his foes like a wild animal.</p>",
