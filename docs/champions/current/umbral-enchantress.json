  "lore": "<p>A creature of eerie beauty and inexhaustible malice, the Umbral Enchantress is a cunning foe to face. She is a Countess of Siroth’s legions and has a well over a hundred lesser demons at her beck and call, but she does not often hide behind the backs of her minions either. Those bold enough to face the Enchantress find themselves under her vile spell, unable to receive the boons and blessings their artifacts or allies might provide. Their wits fail them as well, clouded by the Enchantress’ guile.<br>It is said that the Umbral Enchantress had a mighty rival among her dark kin, a Baron who believed himself unmatched as a warrior and craved to advance through the demonic hierarchy. His mistake was believing the Enchantress weak and unworthy of her position. When tempers boiled and challenges turned to open battle, that arrogant champion found himself powerless and enthralled, consumed by his rage and hacking away at the Enchantress without finesse or strategy. She had slain the Baron easily and fashioned his skull into a decoration for her shield, there to remind everyone of the folly of challenging her.</p>",
