    "lore": "<p>Few would dare argue that the Captain of King Tayba’s personal Guard, Richtoff, known as the “Bold”, earned his title. Born to the family of a stone broke minor noble, Richtoff’s prospects in life were not much better than those of a commoner. But Lumaya herself must have smiled upon him. Rather than being sent as a page to a noble of similar worth (or rather lack thereof) or to his own father, Richtoff’s fate took a different turn. The Grand Tourney in Kaerok Castle gathered nobles from all across the kingdom, no matter how inconsequential they may be. And where most young nobles were content to just watch and dream of the day they could take part themselves, Richtoff attempted to sneak past the guards onto the archery range.</p><p>The King, amused by such a brazen act, stopped his men from dragging Richtoff away and allowed the boy to participate. Many laughed and openly mocked the upstart, yet as soon as Richtoff’s first arrow struck true the murmurs and jeering ceased. He could not match the true masters at that age, of course, but had shown himself to be talented enough to earn his place at Kaerok’s court. There he was given the tools and teachers to hone his skill.</p><p>Upon reaching adulthood Richtoff was already known as one of the best sharpshooters the Kingdom had to offer. He is said to have slain trolls and undead with but a single shot from hundreds of paces away, and none could match the speed with which he reloaded his crossbow to batter the enemy with a hail of quarrels. Now an anointed Knight, Richtoff has recently risen through the ranks to lead the King’s own Guard. And Kaerok’s enemies can be certain, never again shall the King be threatened while his loyal servants keep vigil.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Lady Sethallia hails from the coast of the Land of Rebirth, South of the Castle of Kaerok itself. Her ancestral fief grants control of much of the province, making Sethallia a well-known face at court as well as one of King Tayba’s important vassals. Fiery-tempered and charismatic, she has earned as many enemies among the King’s bannermen as she did friends.</p><p>Her brash nature is well known even among Sethallia’s own people, although it seems her soldiers have grown to adore and respect it. A widely-quoted story tells of her bravery when a small force of Kaerok knights fell into an orc ambush. Seeing a hulking orс chief fell a dozen of her men in that battle, Sethallia cut her way through to the beast and mocked him brazenly. The orc, who is said to have dwarfed even the tallest of King Tayba’s knights, abandoned the wounded soldiers in favour of trampling the foolish noble into the dirt. Yet for all his savagery he could not match Sethallia’s skill. Finally provoked into making a mistake, the orc chief soon found his throat pierced by a spear, and his kin broke and fled the field upon witnessing their leader’s defeat. Needless to say, Lady Sethallia’s reputation as a warrior and her popularity in the King’s army blossomed after that feat.</p><p>For all her recklessness, Sethallia is a capable leader that can both guide her fury to set enemy ranks ablaze with magic or direct her allies to sap away their strength in a relentless assault. But where enemies face naught but fire and wrath, Sethallia’s care has been known to miraculously heal even the most grievous of wounds.</p>",

Like many other Barbarians, he served as a mercenary, battled rival warriors for glory and bragging rights. Even as he grew older, Altan’s prideful nature did not abate.</p><p>And though his strength began to wane, he still craved the same renown and the elation of battle. When accused of becoming old and weak, he did not just give the offenders a good thrashing but also vowed to face the dread dragon Hellrazor alone. Without a word, he gathered his arms and departed for the Beast’s mountain.</p><p>It is unknown what transpired in the Dragon’s lair, for Altan refuses to speak of it. Some say the Arbiter herself intervened and saved him from certain death. Whatever the case may have been, it was clear that Altan did not prevail - yet he did not perish either. When he emerged, the old Barbarian warrior appeared fused with dragonflame that will burn within him forever. He swore fealty to the Arbiter and her fight against the growing Shadow and served her chosen warriors ever since.</p>",

None, until he met Kallia, whose prowess and ability to fly into relentless fury are as immense as her beauty.</p><p>Neither of them truly remembers what sparked the conflict between them, both will, of course, blame their other half. Regardless of the truth of the matter, an argument went out of control, and a battle of words, in which even Atur himself admits he took a thorough thrashing, turned to fisticuffs. Here, their passion for a fight was evenly matched and soon turned to passion for each other.</p><p>Though Barbarians are not exactly sophisticated, if not outright crude, by the standards of Kaerok or Aravia, Atur’s and Kallia’s relationship still blossomed into something sweet and loving… in its own way.

Though they have a long-standing tradition of martial prowess, the once mighty Jotuns have been in decline for centuries. Most tribes have been forced to leave their homeland and band together with other exiles, adding their strength to Barbarian groups or mercenary bands.</p><p>Though they all share an affinity with powers from beyond the material realm, some Jotuns can manifest these powers and add them to their already impressive arsenal. This Champion, in particular, has been marked by primordial fire - or so he believes - which marks him by the bright red colour of his hair, and the ability to summon flames that engulf the blade of his sword.</p>",

None, until he met Kallia, whose prowess and ability to fly into relentless fury are as immense as her beauty.</p><p>Neither of them truly remembers what sparked the conflict between them, both will, of course, blame their other half. Regardless of the truth of the matter, an argument went out of control, and a battle of words, in which even Atur himself admits he took a thorough thrashing, turned to fisticuffs. Here, their passion for a fight was evenly matched and soon turned to passion for each other.</p><p>Though Barbarians are not exactly sophisticated, if not outright crude, by the standards of Kaerok or Aravia, Atur’s and Kallia’s relationship still blossomed into something sweet and loving… in its own way. It is certainly as strong as the mountains that surround their home, and as wild as the sandstorms that sweep the Deadlands.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Hatred is a powerful thing, one that is, perhaps, as hard as death to overcome. Yet even here love finds a way, the story of Belanor and Zavia. Cruel fate had them fight on different sides of one of the many conflicts between the High Elves of Aravia and the exiles known as Dark Elves. Still, even though the bloody fog of war, through hate, and through fury, these two souls were united.</p><p>As stragglers of a battle between the warring Elven factions, they were initially forced to survive an unwelcoming orc-infested desert together. The sheer adversity and the dangers they faced allowed them to see a person behind the mask of an enemy. The passion that was sparked then survived far beyond a temporary alliance of convenience. And, in the end, both Belanor and Zavia chose to escape together rather than continue the feud. Now seen as traitors and deserters by their former allies, the two of them had no choice but to live on the run.</p><p>They faced persecution, poverty, and mortal danger together. Finally, they were captured and sentenced to death for their crimes. Yet when the first light of dawn broke and the jailors arrived to take the fugitives to the scaffold, they were taken aback. The cell was locked and secured, not a single hint at how the captives escaped. The only thing they found were two feathers on the stone floor, one black as night, the other - white as Lumaya’s light. To this day no one knows what transpired on that night, though some, as they often do, attribute the miraculous escape to the Arbiter.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Foli's origins are shrouded in mystery. Some say he was among the first Elves to have been banished from the Kingdom of Aravia for dabbling in the forbidden Dark Arts. Others - that he was unjustly persecuted by his political rivals and forced into exile. Foli himself certainly cares little for rumours and legends, his focus remains on the present and his role in the war against Siroth. For decades, he worked alone, striking alliances and backroom deals with numerous powerful figures across Teleria. His goal was ever the same - to uproot the servants of darkness wherever they could be found, by whatever means necessary.</p><p>His natural talents are enhanced manyfold by the strange armour he wears. Whether created by magical means, or a symbiotic creature eons-old, this living carapace provides exceptional protection and vitality. Crushing blows that would daze and debilitate lesser warriors seem to have little effect, wounds mend as fast as they would beneath a skilled healer's touch, and the armour itself serves as a terrifying extension of Foli's arsenal.</p><p>Such an elusive Champion is not easy to recruit, yet if his loyalty is gained few foes will be able to stand in his Company's way.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>It is no surprise that the cutthroat society of the Dark Elves produces many skilled warriors and assassins. The latter are especially thought after by anyone in Teleria who needs a problem resolved in a swift and bloody manner. Fortunately for her employers, and unfortunately for her victims, the assassin known as the Eviscerator specializes exactly in that. Her gruesome monicker is well-earned, as a bloody trail of successful \"contracts\" left behind would attest. Of course, there is more than simple cruelty at play. In this bloody business a fear-inspiring reputation is certainly quite important.</p><p>Granted, that reputation is coupled with impressive talent. Eviscerator is as lethal as she is graceful, striking with blinding speed and always seeking to find a weak point in the enemy's defenses. Her dual daggers are coated in poison, making certain that even the smallest scratch has a chance of bleeding her victim. Her agility allows to strike from the shadows, throwing enemy formations into disarray. She knows that it would be foolish to let an enemy recover, and always seeks to strike whenever they attempt to recuperate or gain an advantage.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>There are many demonic creatures in service of Siroth, some born of Teleria and its magical ether, others - in the astral planes far beyond the mortal world. Some of these planes consist of naught but eldritch flames and eternal darkness. From there, the Dark Lord summoned forth some of his most powerful minions. Fire Elementals - the personification of rage and destruction given form and will. And among them, Drexthar Bloodtwin is among the most terrifying.</p><p>A being of ancient power, Drexthar's body is little more than an ephemeral spirits created by the ever-burning hellfire. To give him form, Siroth encased the elemental into a suit of might armour and armed him with a vicious blade that feeds on Drexthar's own nature. All those who dare to stand in his way must beware, for not only this servant of Siroth a mighty and experienced warrior that has ended many would-be Champions over thousands of years, but his very being presents a mortal danger as well. Though strikes may yet break through Drexthar's armour, the flames hidden beneath are volatile, hungry, and all too eager to lash out at any creature foolish enough to try extinguishing them.</p><p>Yet Drexthar's nature is also his weakness, for fire does not only consume and destroy - it brings light and warmth as well. Heroes with a sufficiently strong will may be able to bind the elemental to it, cutting him off from his dark master and turning the raw destructive potential to serve good.</p>",

Driven by fear or ambition, a terrible pact has been made by the nobles to retain their status, yet at a dear price - their very souls. Servants of Lumaya say that any mortal to be foolish enough to sign such a pact lives on in torment, their consciousness entrapped in suffocating, eternal darkness. Survive they will, though most will - in time - beg for the release of death.</p><p>And yet there is never a lack of those who are willing to test these tales for the promise of power.</p>",

Cruel fate had them fight on different sides of one of the many conflicts between the High Elves of Aravia and the exiles known as Dark Elves. Still, even though the bloody fog of war, through hate, and through fury, these two souls were united.</p><p>As stragglers of a battle between the warring Elven factions, they were initially forced to survive an unwelcoming orc-infested desert together. The sheer adversity and the dangers they faced allowed them to see a person behind the mask of an enemy. The passion that was sparked then survived far beyond a temporary alliance of convenience. And, in the end, both Belanor and Zavia chose to escape together rather than continue the feud. Now seen as traitors and deserters by their former allies, the two of them had no choice but to live on the run.</p><p>They faced persecution, poverty, and mortal danger together. Finally, they were captured and sentenced to death for their crimes. Yet when the first light of dawn broke and the jailors arrived to take the fugitives to the scaffold, they were taken aback. The cell was locked and secured, not a single hint at how the captives escaped. The only thing they found were two feathers on the stone floor, one black as night, the other - white as Lumaya’s light. To this day no one knows what transpired on that night, though some, as they often do, attribute the miraculous escape to the Arbiter.</p>",

Of course, the reality is much more difficult than that. Nobles and others in power often operate on their own set of laws, evading punishment where someone more humble would pay the full price of their transgression. Still, nobles are not completely immune.</p><p>Few sights cause as much concern and fear at Queen Eva’s court as the Royal Adjudicator Elenaril does. A highborn herself, she is called to settle disputes between her peers or stand judgement over them for their crimes. Intrigue and assassinations are a particularly common offense, and thus Elenaril herself has been targetted by foolish would-be murderers more than once.</p><p>She is as skilled with a bow as she is with courtly manners and her knowledge of Aravian Law. More than once an attempt on her life led to Elenaril serving as both judge and executioner, sometimes by an arrow to the heart, and sometimes by more subtle means. It is no accident that she is well-versed in the most potent poisons known to Elven alchemists and always carries a vast supply of such on her person.</p>",

Through his selfless dedication to others, many lives were improved, sometimes even saved. Never a true soldier at heart, he did nonetheless learn the art of the bow and would stand up to evil without fear in his heart.</p><p>And it was this kindness that saved his own life and gave him a new purpose. Lost in the Mountains of Despair on the Winter Solstice, the hunter had almost abandoned all hope when the cheerful sound of jingling bells rose him from the frost-induced slumber. At first, he could scarcely believe his eyes, for tales of Sir Nicholas were well known to the High Elves, and the poor hunter thought it was all but a dream. But when Lumaya’s servant stepped onto the icy cliffs and the cold receded by his will alone, the Elf fell to his knees and gave praise to the Goddess.</p><p>Yet this miraculous rescue was just the beginning. The hunter’s heart was pure and honest, thus Sir Nicholas gave him a chance to serve Lumaya’s law and bring hope to all those who would accept Her light. Without hesitation, the Merry Elf accepted. Known as Jinglehunter, he now rides into the night with Sir Nicholas on ever Winter Solstice.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Something of an aberration among trollkind, Ignatius is what people call a “civilized savage”. Captured and sold as a slave in his childhood, he found himself in servitude of the High Elves, used for menial tasks and hard labour. But his sharp wit and aptitude for more precise work, when coupled with his natural strength, ensured that Ignatius was apprenticed to one of Aravian blacksmiths.</p><p>As he came of age and learned the secrets of steel, so too did Ignatius’ fame grow; thanks both to his extraordinary talent, and his unusual origins. A slave no longer, he became something of a local celebrity. And yet, the call of blood is not easy to silence.</p><p>Though tales of his people were rarely flattering among the human and elf travelers, Ignatius could not help but greedily consume every bit and rumour that he could find. It was not until his fourth decade that he had finally chosen to set out beyond the only home he ever remembered, and find his people that were lost to him.</p><p>As it turned out, finding other trolls was far easier than being accepted by them. Seen as an outsider and an elf slave, Ignatius had to fight for his very survival. But he has proven to be as mighty and as fearsome as any of his kin. Weapons and armour forged by his own hand were much more impressive than the crude tools most of his adversaries wielded, and helped Ignatius rise above those who would see him dead.</p><p>Now a tolerated - and even at time respected craftsman of one of the largest troll tribes in Aravia, Ignatius forges his own destiny - and that of his people. After all, if through the sheer power of will he can control his innate savagery and only release it in battle, then, perhaps, others will learn to do so too. And who knows, a day may yet come when trolls are seen as something more than wild and loathsome beasts.</p>",

Perhaps it was this innovative approach to combat that allowed this Ogress to become so successful.</p><p>Renowned as a great beauty among her people, she is said to have a long line of suitors coming from among the most fearsome chieftains. Some evil tongues suggest that every single one ended up as the main course of a wedding feast without an actual wedding.

    "lore": "<p>Captured by the Dark Elves, these two ogryn brothers were meant to be little more than cattle for the arena. Though they have proven to be far more skilled and resilient than their captors imagined. By their combined skill and teamwork, the Cagebreaker and the Towering Titan - as they became known to the audience - not only survived, but managed to gain something of a following. Still, their ultimate fate was decided and the two relentless brothers were to meet their end at the hands of the reigning Champion, Grandhammer. Or so it was planned by the slavemasters.</p><p>Grandhammer himself had little desire to keep on shedding blood in the name of slavers that kept him bound and tortured with unspeakable magic.

Some say it helps him to always remember the cost of men's folly and blind fury.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Bards and minstrels have spun many tales about love so pure, it overcomes death itself. While it is, indeed, the stuff of many a ballad (too many, perhaps) the Realm of Teleria had seen these wondrous tales come to life.</p><p>One particular legend speaks of a maiden so fair she caught a jealous eye of an evil Sorcerer, a servant of Siroth's dark will. The spells he weaved allowed him to entrance the maiden and entrap her in a distant stronghold. Fortunately, her faith allowed the maiden to break free and regain her will before the sorcerer's vile designs could be realized, yet she remained a prisoner under threat of imminent death were she not to accept the Sorcerer's advances.</p><p>But all was not lost, for her promised one, a noble Knight of great renown, rose up to the challenge. He fought his way through untold dangers and enemies uncountable before forcing the great gates of the dark keep open. There, the entire might of the Sorceror's magic was unleashed upon him. The Knight cut down hordes of Siroth's servants, ignoring his own wounds and striking the villain down with a single blow of his blessed sword. Though life ebbed away from his body by the moment, he chose to expend the last of his strength on proclaiming his love for the Maiden who was finally free.</p><p>I was at that moment the Arbiter herself interfered. Though Lumaya may never guide the affairs of mortals, her faithful herald would not let a heroic deed driven by love as pure as that turn into tragedy. She used her power to save the dying Knight, yet such divine assistance did come with a price. Unable to live on without her beloved, the Maiden did not hesitate to swear her own soul to Lumaya’s cause. In turn, both she and her Knight were granted with life immortal.</p><p>There are many recountings of their adventures afterward, some contradicting each other, some - the stuff of fairy tales. Even their true names are lost to history, as is any proof that their origins are anything more than legend. Yet one thing is certain - wherever the mysterious lovers known as Venus and Cupidus appear, no darkness may stand before the fires of their passion. With her magic, and his trusty blade, the pair has saved lives beyond counting. Any warrior that gains the loyalty of both of these divine servants will find their force strengthened with the kind of purity only love that transcends mortal boundaries can bring.</p>",

He took first steps upon this land when the world was yet young, he stood alone against odds insurmountable, and felled twisted creatures would devour the sun itself. It was him who ventured beyond the barren tundra and into the ancient frozen wastes of Telerian North to break an army of Ice Giants that threatened to overwhelm the infant human kingdoms. Having slain the Giant King in single combat, he took the castle cut out of a glacier for himself and made it into a fortress dedicated Lumaya.</p><p>Such is the tale of Sir Nicholas, known under different names to the people of Teleria, but ever-present in their folklore. It is said that to this day he sits upon a throne among the towers of jagged ice and gazes upon the world through a scrying crystal gifted by the Arbiter herself. By his judgement do the righteous receive great boons, and the wicked - their just punishment. Though perhaps Sir Nicholas is not as omnipotent a force as some of the old tales paint him, it cannot be denied that many powerful villains disappeared without a trace on a Winter Solstice night...</p>",

While it is, indeed, the stuff of many a ballad (too many, perhaps) the Realm of Teleria had seen these wondrous tales come to life.</p><p>One particular legend speaks of a maiden so fair she caught a jealous eye of an evil Sorcerer, a servant of Siroth's dark will. The spells he weaved allowed him to entrance the maiden and entrap her in a distant stronghold. Fortunately, her faith allowed the maiden to break free and regain her will before the sorcerer's vile designs could be realized, yet she remained a prisoner under threat of imminent death were she not to accept the Sorcerer's advances.</p><p>But all was not lost, for her promised one, a noble Knight of great renown, rose up to the challenge. He fought his way through untold dangers and enemies uncountable before forcing the great gates of the dark keep open. There, the entire might of the Sorceror's magic was unleashed upon him. The Knight cut down hordes of Siroth's servants, ignoring his own wounds and striking the villain down with a single blow of his blessed sword. Though life ebbed away from his body by the moment, he chose to expend the last of his strength on proclaiming his love for the Maiden who was finally free.</p><p>I was at that moment the Arbiter herself interfered. Though Lumaya may never guide the affairs of mortals, her faithful herald would not let a heroic deed driven by love as pure as that turn into tragedy. She used her power to save the dying Knight, yet such divine assistance did come with a price. Unable to live on without her beloved, the Maiden did not hesitate to swear her own soul to Lumaya’s cause. In turn, both she and her Knight were granted with life immortal.</p><p>There are many recountings of their adventures afterward, some contradicting each other, some - the stuff of fairy tales. Even their true names are lost to history, as is any proof that their origins are anything more than legend. Yet one thing is certain - wherever the mysterious lovers known as Venus and Cupidus appear, no darkness may stand before the fires of their passion. With her magic, and his trusty blade, the pair has saved lives beyond counting. Any warrior that gains the loyalty of both of these divine servants will find their force strengthened with the kind of purity only love that transcends mortal boundaries can bring.</p>",

Said to have been a warrior raised by the Sacred Order - one of the fabled Temple Maidens - she saw a vision of a great pillar of light rising above an ancient glacier and burning away the darkness. Upon waking from her sleep, the Maiden knew what she had to do. Having gathered her spear and armour, she ventured out into the frozen lands that lay beyond the walls of her Monastery to follow in the steps of the fabled Sir Nicholas.</p><p>The dangers were many, the foes - deadly. But with skill and faith, the brave young woman fought to overcome them all. She defeated Frostskin trolls that sought to turn the intruder back, purged the undead that rose from beneath the snow, guided by the Shadow’s dark will, and braved daunting mountains on the way to her goal. Not even the fearsome drakes were able to break her resolve.</p><p>Then she saw it - the mighty fortress of stone and ice that rose above the horizon. Battered and wounded, she pressed on for no fatigue could stop her when the goal was in sight. Three days and three nights she walked, waist-deep in snow, and only reached the steps of the fortress when the full moon of the third night shone brightly overhead. There she collapsed, but the light of Lumaya’s servants cannot be extinguished so easily. Sir Nicholas himself stepped forth to lift the brave youth up, and with the Arbiter’s blessing, she was granted eternal life. Ever since that fateful night, the Frostbringer remains a loyal companion and a friend to all those in Sir Nicholas’ band of Champions.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>But, of course, it is not just love that is marked by divine intervention or tragedy that is worthy of the minstrel’s attention. Those are merely good for the dramatic flair that those knights of the lute do so enjoy. More often than not, love overcomes obstacles that are less grand on a cosmic scale, yet no less difficult for the mortals who find themselves entwined.</p><p>The Sacred Order as a whole, while not necessarily enforcing a Vow of Chastity, does forbid its members from having families and heirs - a precaution to make certain positions of power within the Order pass on by right of virtue, not that of blood. Undue attachment is heavily frowned upon as well, outright forbidden in some of the stricter Divisions of the Order.</p><p>It is no surprise then, that the Knights Romero and Juliana had never thought of themselves falling in love. Romero, ever coolheaded and pious found himself at odds with the young and brash Juliana, whose skill with the blade and fiery zeal led her to many mortal perils that she, to the young Knight’s credit, honourably overcame. But a life full of battles does tend to make emotions run wild. In time, the two warmed up to one another’s “quirks”, learned to appreciate them even. Their eventual union, though it may never be formalized by marriage, remains true and tested. Neither did that union affect their relationship as comrades-in-arms, if anything it allowed the two Knights to fight as one. Where Romero’s natural cautiousness may lead to him losing momentum, Juliana’s brazen but no less skillful tactics ensure that their forces control the initiative. And where Juliana may begin losing herself in the heat of battle, Romero is always there to serve as an anchor of reason. To this day, they remain among the Order’s prominent warriors and are ready to bring Lumaya’s light wherever it is needed most.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Sometimes love blossoms early, and remains in the hearts of those touched by its warmth for the rest of their lives. Such is the tale of Fenax and Tallia. He was the son of a destitute noble, serving in the household of Tallia’s father. She - a cherished heiress. Though they have sworn to marry one another as children, no one had taken that vow seriously. And by the time Tallia’s father realized that this was more than childish games, that their love was not fading, it was far too late. The girl was far too headstrong and wild to be cowed into obedience, and the aging Lord had come up with a cunning and dark plot.</p><p>Fenax, then a squire, was sent with an “important message” to a neighboring bannerman. Alone with no escort, of course, as messengers had to travel light and swift. By the Lord’s design, a group of orc raiders was meant to ambush and slay Fenax - a tragedy to be sure, but one that his daughter would forget in time. Unfortunately for the Lord, he failed to take Fenax’s wit into account. Though indeed ambushed and brought low, he managed to convince his captors that he was, in fact, the heir of an important baron who would pay the savages handsomely. The greedy brigands were quick to drag him off to the camp instead, hoping to fool the Lord and gain both rewards.</p><p>And when the searching party that went after Fenax upon him “suddenly” going missing on the road, Tallia’s father became concerned. He ignored his daughter’s pleas to send a group of men-at-arms to rescue her beloved from the orcs, who left plenty of traces to be identified. The Lord refused in anger, yet once more he had miscalculated. Furious, Tallia escaped the castle to mount a rescue on her own.</p><p>A dangerous venture, to be sure. But fate was not always cruel. A Sacred Order patrol came across the young Lady, their Sergeant a man of honour and piety that did not shrink away from his duty to protect the innocent. With their help, Tallia managed to find and free Fenax from the raiders after a vicious battle in which she too was baptised by fire.</p><p>Though after a loving embrace was shared and words of comfort were spoken, the Tallia could not help but wonder what was so important that her beloved had to risk his life to deliver. She unsealed the letter only to devoid of a single drop of ink. But it was not needed, the empty parchment spoke of her father’s betrayal louder than any words could. Hurt and furious, the two young lovers did not, however, let themselves be broken. Unwilling to return to the man that would see them separated so cruelly, they both swore an oath to join the Order and dedicate their lives to Lumaya, an oath that they have carried out with honour against servants of darkness beyond counting - together.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Sometimes love blossoms early, and remains in the hearts of those touched by its warmth for the rest of their lives. Such is the tale of Fenax and Tallia. He was the son of a destitute noble, serving in the household of Tallia’s father. She - a cherished heiress. Though they have sworn to marry one another as children, no one had taken that vow seriously. And by the time Tallia’s father realized that this was more than childish games, that their love was not fading, it was far too late. The girl was far too headstrong and wild to be cowed into obedience, and the aging Lord had come up with a cunning and dark plot.</p><p>Fenax, then a squire, was sent with an “important message” to a neighboring bannerman. Alone with no escort, of course, as messengers had to travel light and swift. By the Lord’s design, a group of orc raiders was meant to ambush and slay Fenax - a tragedy to be sure, but one that his daughter would forget in time. Unfortunately for the Lord, he failed to take Fenax’s wit into account. Though indeed ambushed and brought low, he managed to convince his captors that he was, in fact, the heir of an important baron who would pay the savages handsomely. The greedy brigands were quick to drag him off to the camp instead, hoping to fool the Lord and gain both rewards.</p><p>And when the searching party that went after Fenax upon him “suddenly” going missing on the road, Tallia’s father became concerned. He ignored his daughter’s pleas to send a group of men-at-arms to rescue her beloved from the orcs, who left plenty of traces to be identified. The Lord refused in anger, yet once more he had miscalculated. Furious, Tallia escaped the castle to mount a rescue on her own.</p><p>A dangerous venture, to be sure. But fate was not always cruel. A Sacred Order patrol came across the young Lady, their Sergeant a man of honour and piety that did not shrink away from his duty to protect the innocent. With their help, Tallia managed to find and free Fenax from the raiders after a vicious battle in which she too was baptised by fire.</p><p>Though after a loving embrace was shared and words of comfort were spoken, the Tallia could not help but wonder what was so important that her beloved had to risk his life to deliver. She unsealed the letter only to devoid of a single drop of ink. But it was not needed, the empty parchment spoke of her father’s betrayal louder than any words could. Hurt and furious, the two young lovers did not, however, let themselves be broken. Unwilling to return to the man that would see them separated so cruelly, they both swore an oath to join the Order and dedicate their lives to Lumaya, an oath that they have carried out with honour against servants of darkness beyond counting - together.</p>",

It was only a timely intervention by the Sacred Order outrider patrol that saved the girl from sharing the fate of her family, although starving to death was not a much better prospect. Fortunately for Hope, her plea did not go unheard and she was adopted into one of the Order’s abbeys, there to be educated and trained. Crafstmen and caterers of all sorts are always in demand, and it is to everyone’s benefit if orphans and the destitute that the Order cares for repay their debt by a life-long dedication.</p><p>But it was not a life of peace that Hope sought. Her experiences have molded the young woman and drove her to excel in the ways of war. She swore a mighty oath to Lumaya, pleading the Goddess to give her strength, so that by Hope’s hand atrocities such as what has been inflicted upon her family can be prevented.</p><p>Whether it is Lumaya’s grace indeed or the strength of Hope’s own conviction, but she has forged her path as a champion of the innocent ever since. She does not flinch in delivering ruthless justice to the unholy and the lawless, but it is her kindness and selfless devotion to her allies that make Hope a boon for any band of Champions. Her faith alone can serve as a powerful shield to those at her side, yet her wrath is terrible to behold as well. Her blade can do much more than simply break armour and rend flesh. By the power of faith, it dispells protective magic that many-an-enemy uses, exposing them to Hope’s fellow Champions.</p>",

Those are merely good for the dramatic flair that those knights of the lute do so enjoy. More often than not, love overcomes obstacles that are less grand on a cosmic scale, yet no less difficult for the mortals who find themselves entwined.</p><p>The Sacred Order as a whole, while not necessarily enforcing a Vow of Chastity, does forbid its members from having families and heirs - a precaution to make certain positions of power within the Order pass on by right of virtue, not that of blood. Undue attachment is heavily frowned upon as well, outright forbidden in some of the stricter Divisions of the Order.</p><p>It is no surprise then, that the Knights Romero and Juliana had never thought of themselves falling in love. Romero, ever coolheaded and pious found himself at odds with the young and brash Juliana, whose skill with the blade and fiery zeal led her to many mortal perils that she, to the young Knight’s credit, honourably overcame. But a life full of battles does tend to make emotions run wild. In time, the two warmed up to one another’s “quirks”, learned to appreciate them even. Their eventual union, though it may never be formalized by marriage, remains true and tested. Neither did that union affect their relationship as comrades-in-arms, if anything it allowed the two Knights to fight as one. Where Romero’s natural cautiousness may lead to him losing momentum, Juliana’s brazen but no less skillful tactics ensure that their forces control the initiative. And where Juliana may begin losing herself in the heat of battle, Romero is always there to serve as an anchor of reason. To this day, they remain among the Order’s prominent warriors and are ready to bring Lumaya’s light wherever it is needed most.</p>",

The Dark Elves, though often allied with certain tribes, are particularly fond of capturing the creatures they see as little more than beasts and using them for back-breaking labour or bloody gladiator battles for their own twisted amusement. Sometimes, the unfortunate few become the unwilling subjects for magicians seeking to unlock further mysteries of the Dark Arts.</p><p>Such was the fate of a minotaur known only as Hakkorhn Smashlord today. Whatever his former life used to be, it was burned to ashes. Everything stripped from him. Horrific experiments conducted by a Dark Elf witch coven infused the poor creature with a fiery rage that could not be quenched. Thus strengthened beyond even his beastly physique, the Smashlord was unleashed upon one of the slave-fighter arenas. The results were far more spectacular than his new masters could imagine, and for years the Hakkorhn reigned as the undisputed champion. But despite the various enchantments and hexes, the minotaur's will still simmered underneath. Slowly, he started regaining his former self until one fateful day where, in the midst of combat, the Smashlord turned on his captors and cut a bloody swathe through the guards with the help of his fellow slaves. Such was the carnage, that the stunned Dark Elves did not give pursuit until reinforcements arrived from a neighboring hold. And by that point, Hakkorhn and the other rebels were long gone.</p><p>Though still tortured by dark spells that once bound his will, the Hakkorhn roams the land as an errant warrior in search of a worthy cause to lend his strength to.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>An outcast among outcasts, the Reinbeast’s very survival is as much a miracle as it is a testament to his strength and determination. Born in the darkest depths of the Durkham Forest on a cold winter morning, he was immediately marked by the strange colour of his coat and a glowing red nose. All through his childhood, the Reinbeast had to fight all those who would see him cast out. Yet beatings and cruelty only hardened the poor creature and taught him to stand tall and proud no matter the hardship.</p><p>But on one stormy night, when the wind howled like a wounded dragon among the twisted and gnarled trees of Durkham, and a terrible blizzard swept the land, his fate was changed forever. Forced out into the night by his tribe’s chief on a fool’s errand that was no doubt meant to see him dead, the Reinbeast came across a most confusing sight. A sleigh full of strange items stood there, encased by ice, and a man clad in armour of silver and red worked tirelessly to fix the damage. A small pack of reindeers shivered at his side, cold and tired, no longer able to pull the heavy carriage. Though suspicious at first, the Reinbeast was moved by the pure light that seemed to be emanating from that mysterious human, and the care he showed in trying to help his exhausted steeds.</p><p>He approached, cautiously, and offered help in a broken Common tongue. To his surprise, the man’s own words boomed within his mind loud and clear, as if spoken by one of his own people. Sir Nicholas, as the strange introduced himself, was most grateful for the aid. And with the Reinbeast now placed in the lead, his own reindeers finally managed to free the sleigh and press on their way. With magic beyond imagining, they went across Teleria in a single night to reward the just and punish the wicked, with the Reinbeast’s glowing nose leading their way. It was no surprise that when offered a single wish for his selfless help, the Reinbeast asked to remain in Sir Nicholas’ service - and thus he has remained for centuries, pulling the mighty sleigh through blizzards and storms, and fighting at Sir Nicholas’ side when such a need arose.</p>",

But the blow never came – the elf who beat him declared him a worthy foe, spared his life, and even returned his weapon to him to that he might leave the field with honor, all in the face of the jeering spectators.</p><p>Truly impressed by the valor of the elf, Ripper offered him any boon he might grant. No one knows with certainty what was asked – only that the next day Ripper departed Ireth in the direction of the Dark Ravine, and that where Wanderer appears, Ripper soon follows. Some speculate this is his task – to seek out Wanderer and bring the traitor’s head to Queen Eva to repay the elven debt of honor.</p>",

The castle was stormed and taken. Hexia herself had been dragged to a forest beyond the town walls and hanged on an old oak. Legend says that in her last breath, the vile sorceress cursed her former subjects and vowed vengeance.</p><p>But even death was not the end for her, as the blood rituals Hexia performed allowed her spirit to remain, possessing her dead body once more and exacting a horrible price upon the townsfolk that dared take everything from her. Whether or not that is the case, the castle and the town surrounding it have been devastated by plague not a month after Hexia’s execution and burned to a cinder to stop the disease from spreading.</p><p>Even now, the burned-out ruins that sit upon a barren hill and are considered to be a blighted place by the locals. Some brave adventurers dare to stray into the ruined castle’s catacombs in search of the sorceress’ riches.

He tempts with excess and indulgence, pulling more and more willing servants into his net wherever he can. Such was the fate of a young noble of Kaerok, vain and greedy, he wished for nothing more than to better his position in power and lot in life. By the magic of Siroth’s necromancers, and by his own dark deeds he was granted a vampire’s “kiss”, turning into one of the undead beasts himself. But his pact with the Shadow stood firm, for the noble was allowed to retain his humanly looks that he so adored - for a time, at least.</p><p>One can only imagine this wicked Seducer’s shock and surprise when he was faced with another servant of Siroth, known as the Temptress. A child of a vampire and a mortal woman, she was as vain and self-assured as he was himself. And throughout all his attempts to gain the upper hand, the Seducer only succeeded in catching himself in his own trap. For even the darkest heart can sometimes be illuminated by Lumaya’s light, and he found himself hopelessly in love and at the whims of the woman he sought to outdo.</p><p>Still, it may not be such a horrible fate in the end, for despite their mutual viciousness and less than savoury practices, the two of them do go together as well as a werewolf and a full moon. That connection is hard to deny, and it overcomes even the deeply ingrained selfishness that both of them were so known for.</p>",

    "lore": "<p>Where Lumaya brings us the purity of love, Siroth places his bets on the pure carnal desire. He tempts with excess and indulgence, pulling more and more willing servants into his net wherever he can. Such was the fate of a young noble of Kaerok, vain and greedy, he wished for nothing more than to better his position in power and lot in life. By the magic of Siroth’s necromancers, and by his own dark deeds he was granted a vampire’s “kiss”, turning into one of the undead beasts himself. But his pact with the Shadow stood firm, for the noble was allowed to retain his humanly looks that he so adored - for a time, at least.</p><p>One can only imagine this wicked Seducer’s shock and surprise when he was faced with another servant of Siroth, known as the Temptress. A child of a vampire and a mortal woman, she was as vain and self-assured as he was himself. And throughout all his attempts to gain the upper hand, the Seducer only succeeded in catching himself in his own trap. For even the darkest heart can sometimes be illuminated by Lumaya’s light, and he found himself hopelessly in love and at the whims of the woman he sought to outdo.</p><p>Still, it may not be such a horrible fate in the end, for despite their mutual viciousness and less than savoury practices, the two of them do go together as well as a werewolf and a full moon. That connection is hard to deny, and it overcomes even the deeply ingrained selfishness that both of them were so known for.</p>",
